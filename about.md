Hello!
I'm AcroCatabro, but you can just call me Acro ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my small blog. Here I share stuff that doesn't fit into microblogs character limit.

I do 3D environment art for video games for living.
Aside from work, I usually draw, model and write about my original characters. And play video games of course.

You can find me of various social platforms:
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@AcroCatabro)
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/acrocatabro.bsky.social)
- [X/Twitter](https://x.com/Acro_Catabro)
- [Telegram (RU)](t.me/AcroCatabro)

I'll be happy if you follow me there ðŸ™‚

I also have a [Linktree page](https://linktr.ee/acrocatabro) where I keep the most up-to-date list of links to my various profiles online.
