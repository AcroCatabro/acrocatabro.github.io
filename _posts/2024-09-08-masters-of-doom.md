An awesome book written in simple and easily understandable manner. I can recommend it not only to gamers interested in the history of the legendary game studio, but also to people who are curious about the world of gamedev in general.

In a way, the book was a small nostalgic trip into a childhood for me. In addition to all the new (and inspiring!) information that I have gathered from it, of course.

Doom 2 was the first ever video game in my life. When I was 5-6 years old, my mother took me with her to visit her friend and he put me by the computer to play Doom while he and my mom were chatting at the kitchen. Of course, he didn't explain anything to me, so the little me spent half an hour in the starting room trying to figure out which buttons to press and why was I dying. By the time I started to figure out the controls, I had already been taken away from the computer. But the game made an unforgettable impression on me. Ever since then, Doom 2 has remained one of my favorite games to this day, which I run at least once a year.

Listening to how the two Johns, Carmack and Romero, coincidentally met and decided to make video games that turned the world of video games upside down - it was a little sad to realize that the romance of the "garage" game dev of the 90s has forever become a thing of the past. The video games back then were simpler, the developers were simpler, the gamers were simpler. Different time, different rules. Now something remotely similar can only be found among indie developers and small studios. <br>
In 2017-2019, I was also part of such a small indie studio. And the way the idSoftware team developed in the 1990s brought back fond memories of that time and the people I was lucky enough to meet while working in it.

At the beginning of 2024, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Doom series, there was a broadcast where both Johns met again many years after their paths parted. And, as if nothing had happened, both have remembered the past and all sorts of everyday moments from their time together at idSoftware. <br>
After reading the book and knowing how controversial both Carmack and Romero were in their youth, it was interesting and nice to see how both of them changed with age and how their views on many things changed as well.

Big thank you to David Kushner and everyone who was involved in writing this book. <br>
And big thank you to idSoftware for making my very first and favorite video game ðŸ™‚
