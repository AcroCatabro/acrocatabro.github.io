Kodansha has recently [announced](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-08-20/with-you-and-the-rain-comedy-manga-gets-2025-tv-anime/.214573) an anime adaptation of "Ame to Kimi to" for next year. And I thought it was a good reason to say a few words about the original manga.

I stumbled upon "Ame to Kimi to" about two years ago, in September 2022. And immediately fell in love with both main characters - a slightly melancholic writer and her restless pet raccoon, who understands human speech and communicates with her through a notebook.<br>
Since then, those two have been lifting my spirits every now and then with their antics, situations and episodes from their daily lives.<br>
Some chapters feel a little bit boring to me - like those where other characters (parents, neighbors, a veterinarian, random passers-by) join the inseparable couple. They are also fun and uplifting, but they seem a little overloaded for my taste. <br>
My favorite episodes are still those where the raccoon and his mistress spend time alone, brightening up each other's loneliness. Just like that fateful rainy day when a lonely young writer accidentally stumbled upon an equally lonely homeless raccoon.<br>
It's a pity, though, that new chapters are released quite rarely, about once a month.
